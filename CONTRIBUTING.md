## Fixing issues in existing material

You can help improve the quality of existing webinar materials in two ways

- Open a GitHub issue outlining the issue you've found in the materials and we will triage and address them.
- Clone the repository, create a branch and submit a PR.
  - We ask that you branch off `main` and prefix your branch with `fix/`
  - Please adhere to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for your PR and commit titles.
